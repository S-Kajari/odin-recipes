    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What is sexier than an easy dinner that doesn't take a lot of time or strange ingredients, heat up the house, or require a lot of clean up? This is a spicy, saucy, juicy meatloaf made in an air fryer. In less than an hour - but more importantly, with very little effort - you can have a delicious and tender meatloaf on the table. Serve with mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground veal</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup gluten-free bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 medium spring onions, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Sriracha salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons gluten-free chipotle chili sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine pork and veal in a nonstick baking dish that fits inside the air fryer basket. Make a well and add egg, cilantro, bread crumbs, spring onions, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of Sriracha salt. Mix well using your hands. Form a loaf inside the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine ketchup, chipotle chili sauce, olive oil, and molasses in a small bowl and whisk well. Set aside, but do not refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Cook meatloaf in the air fryer for 25 minutes without opening the basket. Remove meatloaf and top with ketchup mixture, covering the top completely. Return meatloaf to air fryer and bake until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Turn off air fryer and let meatloaf rest inside for 5 minutes. Take meatloaf out and let rest 5 minutes more before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
